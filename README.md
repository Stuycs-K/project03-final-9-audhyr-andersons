# PROJECT NAME HERE
War!(The Card Game)
### GROUP NAME HERE

### Project Description:

It is the card game war in C where a client connects to a host and plays war against the server or other players that connect.
  
### Instructions:

The server runs the game by running the command make server

The clients run it by running make client


NOTE: There is an issue where if one player disconnects, the other will sometimes be told they lost (because of empty hand) instead of winning
by default. This is present in the final version, but uncommon enough that we couldn't figure out what causes it, which is why we couldn't fix it.
