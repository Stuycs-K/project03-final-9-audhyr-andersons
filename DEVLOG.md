### 2024-01-03 - Brief description
We brainstormed which game to create and what features we would add to the game to fufill all of the requirements. 
We decided to make the card game war in C and we thought about adding a save and resume feature to the game.
Then we asked Mr. K if he thought it would be enough for two people and that it was a reasonable

### 2024-01-04 - Brief description
In class we further discussed our proposal and added to our technical details and pacing.
We sorted out which data types we would use and decided that we would use two structs.

For homework I set up and created all the files I think we will need for our project.

### 2024-01-05 - Brief description
I started setting up game.h with structs and includes. Then I set up functions to create cards and to add cards to the end of a linked list.
I also updated the makefile to work a bit.
 
For hw I continued adding functions and make a file to test the functions in the game.c file
I made functions for printing the deck of cards and preparing for how they will be printed in game.
Finished setting up war code and testing it and finished game logic


### 2024-01-06 - Brief description
I made a function to remove a card in the middle of the deck.
I started on a function to actually play the game
I started making a function to recursively call and handle war in case it happens many times in a row.

We brainstormed which game to create and what features we would add to the game to fufill all of the requirements.
Then we asked Mr. K if he thought it would be enough for two people and that it was a reasonable scope for the project.
He said it was and then we started working on the Proposal.md.

In class we further discussed our proposal and added to our technical details and pacing.
We sorted out which data types we would use and decided that we would use two structs.

### 2024-01-05 - Brief description
We discussed some of the structuring for how we'd make the game itself. I added a few includes, listed a few functions,
and started writing the function to fill an empty deck.

For hw I fixed a few typos and small errors. And then I finished the function to generate a deck and made a function to shuffle
the deck. Everything in game.c should be working. I also added on to the makefile a bit. 

### 2024-01-06 - Brief description
We planned out how to structure turns in the game. I added a function to count the number of cards in a deck, and started working on
a function to save the game.
