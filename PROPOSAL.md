# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Spencer Anderson, Riasat Audhy
       
# Intentions:

Make the cardgame war in C.
    
# Intended usage:

Players can connect to the server to play war against a computer. They will be able to save and resume progress on a game. This can potentially end up with the server connecting to multiple players at once, with players having the option to play against each other.
  
# Technical Details:

A description of your technical design. This should include:
   
How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.
     
How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.
  
What data structures you will be using and how.
     
What algorithms and /or data structures you will be using, and how.
    
# Intended pacing:

By Monday the 8th we plan to have the basic logic of the game coded.
We also plan to have all of the features we will implement thought out and writen in psudo code.
